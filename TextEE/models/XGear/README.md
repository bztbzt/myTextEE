## DEGREE

We implement the model from [Multilingual Generative Language Models for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Event Argument Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08308). This model suports event argument extraction. The code is adapted from the original [codebase](https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/X-Gear).
