## DEGREE

We implement the model from [DEGREE: A Data-Efficient Generation-Based Event Extraction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12724). This model suports end-to-end event extraction, event detection, and event argument extraction. The code is adapted from the original [codebase](https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/DEGREE).
