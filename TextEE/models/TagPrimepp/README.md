## TagPrime

We implement the model from [TAGPRIME: A Unified Framework for Relational Structure Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12585). This model suports event detection and event argument extraction. The code is adapted from the original [codebase](https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/TagPrime).
