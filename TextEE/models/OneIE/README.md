## OneIE

We implement the model from [A Joint Neural Model for Information Extraction with Global Features](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.713/). This model suports end-to-end event extraction. The code is adapted from the original [codebase](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/software/oneie/).
